Everything is just a plugin.

You can extend your own MongoCamp Server Instance by add plugins to have some additional features. 

There are different ways to add your plugin's in MongoCamp Server. The easiest way is to add the plugins to the configuration [PLUGINS_MODULES](../config/properties/plugins-module.md), or you can add the Plugin JAR in the Folder you defined in `PLUGINS_DIRECTORY`.
